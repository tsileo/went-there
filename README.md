# went-there

Lua application built to run on [ge0](https://github.com/tsileo/ge0) that I use to track my locations using [Are You Tracking Me?](https://github.com/tsileo/are-you-tracking-me).

The reverse geolocation data needs to be loaded in `ge0`.

Open-sourced to demo what `ge0` can do, no external contributions will be accepted, but feel free to fork the project.
